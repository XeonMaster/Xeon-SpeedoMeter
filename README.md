# Xeon SpeedoMeter

## Introduction:
This is another simple filterscript for SA:MP server (GTA SA: Modification).
This filterscript is a speedmeter with arrows (analog speedo).

## Requipements:

All you needs is a_samp and edistance includes.

a_samp is already included by default (server package)
edistance edited version (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XeonMaster/Xeon-SpeedoMeter/master/pawno/include/edistance.inc)

## How its works?

When a player get in a vehicle the textdraw showup  (speedo) and after the player get out of the car the textdraw disappear, Gear detection and KM Counter is automaticly done! you don't need anything!

# Xeon SpeedoMeter

## Description
This is a simple filterscript for SA:MP, which is a GTA San Andreas modification.
This filterscript is a speedometer with digital displays and an analogue needle.


## Requirements
All you need are the SA:MP includes, [foreach](https://github.com/karimcambridge/SAMP-foreach) and a PAWN compiler.

The SA:MP includes are already included inside the server package by default.
You can get foreach from https://github.com/karimcambridge/SAMP-foreach or a carbon copy from this repository.


## How does it work?
The speedometer is shown when a player is inside a vehicle. Gear detection and a kilometer counter are included inside the speedometer aswell.
